# AtSchool

Created this project to try my hand at declarative logic programming in Haskell, using the type system and monadic binds to emulate backtracking. 

It was intended to solve the following problem, taken from [here](https://puzzle.dse.nl/logical/index_us.html).

The question is reproduced here as follows:
```
At School ★★★★

Mr. Dutch, Mr. English, Mr. Painter, and Mr. Writer are all teachers at the same secondary school. Each teacher teaches two different subjects. Furthermore:

    three teachers teach Dutch language;
    there is only one math teacher;
    there are two teachers for chemistry;
    two teachers, Simon and Mr. English, teach history;
    Peter does not teach Dutch language;
    Steven is chemistry teacher;
    Mr. Dutch does not teach any course that is taught by Karl or Mr. Painter.

The question: What is the full name of each teacher and which two subjects does each one teach?
